In this section, Latour discusses the different meanings of the word "design" in English and French. He highlights how the term is used in various contexts and how its meaning can change based on the language and cultural background.



### What are Hypernyms?

Hypernyms are words that have a broader meaning than a given word. For example, "vehicle" is a hypernym of "car" because it encompasses all types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles. In contrast, "car" is a hyponym of "vehicle" because it is a specific type of vehicle. Hypernyms help to categorize and organize language by grouping words with similar meanings under a more general term.
