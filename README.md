In 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote a visionary essay that urged scientists to redirect their creative capacities from weapons of war to instruments for the intellect. He develops the idea of the Memex, a desk-sized device imagined to mimic the mind's associative workings in order to store and link information.

Let's read about it together!

Bush is concerned about the rapid expansion of human knowledge.

He describes an overwhelming surge of scientific output that exceeds our capacity to make sense of it. While research proliferates, the tools for navigating it cannot keep up.


Throughout this essay, he refers to a variety of tasks associated with knowledge work and sees a mismatch in scholarly labor.

However, a wave of promising technologies is ushering in an era in which complex mechanical and electrical devices are already changing knowledge work.

Recording and communication media are evolving rapidly. They are shrinking in size, improving in speed, and increasing in capacity to store and transmit information.


For Bush, a central concept is the record. The way he writes about it, it is both archive and infrastructure, a cumulative body of human knowledge that is continuously extended, stored, and consulted. 
[](txt/#bush&annotations=!2_record(750,485,0,109,143))

The record is a living repository, not a static monument.


Records can be texts, observations, images, or notes. They are the building blocks of the larger record, but their value lies not in mere accumulation, but in being accessed and made sense of. 
[](txt/#bush&annotations=!5_record(750,485,0,109,143))

Without effective mechanisms of consultation, the whole point of the record becomes inert.


Beyond the record, Bush distinguishes between data as raw input, material as working medium, and records as structured output. 
[](txt/#bush&annotations=!16_record(750,485,0,109,143);data(630,510,0,109,143);material(770,550,0,109,143))

Scientific work depends on the flow between these phases.


[](txt/#bush&annotations=!1_memex(750,520,255,64,255))
Bush describes the Memex as a technologically enhanced workspace for storing and navigating large collections of documents, notes, and communication.

He mentions a range of well-known artifacts, to help readers of the 1940s imagine this special reading setup.


The Memex is conceived around the idea that thinking is associative, not hierarchical.

Instead of relying on indices or categories, a central idea is to be able to create links and follow trails.

These trails are navigable paths between records that can be extended, revisited, and shared.


The Memex vision anticipated many of today's information systems, as well as enduring challenges. 
While some aspects of its associative principle have been realized, others remain to be done.

Textarium is a modest experiment in this tradition, driven by the desire to make interpretation more traceable.
