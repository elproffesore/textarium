Hypernyms are words that have a broader meaning than a given word. For example, "vehicle" is a hypernym of "car" because it encompasses all types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles. In contrast, "car" is a hyponym of "vehicle" because it is a specific type of vehicle. Hypernyms help to categorize and organize language by grouping words with similar meanings under a more general term.
