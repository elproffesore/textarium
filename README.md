In 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote a visionary essay that urged scientists to redirect their creative capacities from weapons of war to instruments for the intellect. In this article, he develops the idea of the Memex, a desk-sized device imagined to mimic the mind's associative workings in order to store and link information.

*This is Textarium, an experimental interface created in 2025 for interpreting textual sources.*

Bush is concerned about the rapid expansion of human knowledge.

He describes the overwhelming surge of scientific output exceeding our capacity to make sense of it. While research proliferates, the tools for navigating it cannot keep up with the mass.

Lastly, processing is where Bush places maybe the greatest transformative potential.

Overall, these technologies are becoming smaller, faster, and more capable of recording, storing, transmitting, displaying, and processing information. It is almost as if these technologies herald the advent of the information societyâ€¦


For Bush, the central concept is the record. In his writing, it is both an archive and an infrastructure: a cumulative body of human knowledge that is continuously extended, stored, and consulted. 
[](txt/#bush&annotations=!2_record(750,485,0,109,143))


Records can be texts, observations, images, or notes. They are the building blocks of the larger record, but their value lies not in mere accumulation, but in being accessed and made sense of. 
[](txt/#bush&annotations=!7_record(750,554,0,109,143))

Without effective mechanisms of consultation, the whole point of the record becomes inert.


Beyond the record, Bush distinguishes between data as raw input, material as working medium, and records as structured output. 
[](txt/#bush&annotations=!16_record(739,416,0,109,143);data(686,649,0,109,143);material(792,548,0,109,143))

Scholarly work depends on the efficient flow between these phases. This is where he situates his futuristic vision of knowledge work augmented by technology.


[](txt/#bush&annotations=!1_MEMEX(750,520,255,64,255))
Bush describes the Memex as a technologically enhanced workspace for storing and navigating large collections of documents, notes, and correspondence.

He mentions a range of well-known artifacts, to help readers of the 1940s imagine this unique setup.


The system is based on the idea that thinking is associative, not hierarchical.

Instead of relying on indices or categories, one would create and follow trails.


These trails are navigable paths between records that can be extended, revisited, and shared.

The concept of navigable trails is widely considered an early precursor to hypertext, and consequently, the web.

Codes serve as precise addresses for retrieving specific records and as connectors for forming associations between them.

Akin to hyperlinks, codes allow users to create custom trails and quickly access records, turning static storage into a dynamic network of meaning.


The Memex vision anticipated many of today's information systems, including some of their shortcomings. While aspects of its associative principle endure, others remain fragmentary or forgotten.
